## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

SMB 사업주에게 AI의 비즈니스 기회를 보여주고, 실전 도구와 템플릿을 제공하되, 궁극적으로 ezmate.ai 서비스 세일즈로 이어지는 HVCO (High-Value Content Offer).

### 1.2 Sell Like Crazy Framework 적용

```
이북 전체 구조 = Sabri Suby의 "Magic Lantern" 프레임워크

Phase 1: ATTRACT (Ch1-2)
  → AI의 놀라운 기회를 보여줌 → "나도 해보고 싶다"

Phase 2: EDUCATE (Ch3-5)
  → 실제 도구와 방법을 알려줌 → 진짜 유용한 정보 → 신뢰 구축
  → 동시에 복잡성을 자연스럽게 느끼게 함 → "생각보다 손이 많이 가네"

Phase 3: CONVERT (Ch6-7 + CTA)
  → ROI를 직접 계산하게 함 → "이거 하면 돈이 되겠다"
  → 직접 하는 로드맵 vs 전문가에게 맡기는 옵션 제시
  → Godfather Offer → "안 할 이유가 없네"
```

### 1.3 Sales Psychology (챕터별 숨겨진 의도)

| Chapter | 표면적 가치 | 숨겨진 세일즈 의도 |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Ch1 | AI 기회 교육 | 흥분시키기 — "이걸 안 하면 손해" |
| Ch2 | 3가지 도구 소개 | 도구가 3개나 필요하다는 인식 심기 |
| Ch3 | 챗봇 만들기 가이드 | 실제로 해보면 시간이 꽤 걸린다는 것을 깨닫게 함 |
| Ch4 | 음성 AI 가이드 | 기술적 난이도가 올라감 → "전문가가 필요할 수도" |
| Ch5 | 자동화 가이드 | 3개를 연결하는 게 복잡함 → "직접 하긴 어렵겠다" |
| Ch6 | ROI 계산 | 숫자로 확인 → "투자 가치가 있다" → 구매 결정 촉진 |
| Ch7 | 실행 로드맵 | Option A(DIY) vs Option B(전문가) → B가 압도적으로 매력적 |

### 1.4 Target Audience (Dream Buyer)

- 비개발자 SMB 사업주
- 매출 $100K-$2M 규모
- AI에 관심 있지만 시작 방법을 모름
- 시간이 부족하고, 리드 손실에 좌절하는 사람
- 투자할 의향은 있지만 리스크가 걱정되는 사람

---

### Chapter 4: Build Your AI Voice Agent (4 pages)

**Sell Like Crazy Phase: EDUCATE — Increase perceived complexity**

**Content:**

**Section 1: Why Voice Still Matters (0.5 page)**

Step-by-step:
1. Create account at retellai.com
2. Choose an AI voice (multiple natural-sounding options)
3. Design your conversation flow:

   - Handle FAQs → Provide answers
   - Book appointment → Confirm details
   - Transfer to human → When AI cannot help
4. Set up a phone number (local or toll-free)
5. Configure business hours and fallback behavior
6. Test extensively before going live

**Section 3: 3 Voice Agent Use Cases (1.5 pages)**

Use Case 1 — Inbound Call Handling:
- AI answers: "Thank you for calling [Business]. How can I help you today?"
- Handles common questions naturally
- Collects caller information
- Books appointments or transfers to team
- Script template included

Use Case 2 — Appointment Reminders (Outbound):

- Reduces no-shows by 30-40%

Use Case 3 — Missed Lead Follow-Up:
- When someone visits your website but doesn't convert
- AI calls within 5 minutes: "Hi, I noticed you were looking at [service] on our website. Do you have any questions I can help with?"
- Turns window-shoppers into booked calls

**Section 4: Real Example (0.5 page)**
Dental clinic case study:
- Before: 3 staff members handling phones, 40% of calls going to voicemail
- After: AI handles 80% of calls, no-shows reduced by 40%
- Staff freed up for in-person patient care
- Monthly savings: $4,500 in staff time

⚡ **Mini CTA Box:**
> "Voice AI setup requires careful scripting and testing to sound natural. Our team has built voice agents for 16+ industries. We know exactly what works. See page XX for our Done-For-You service."

**Hidden intent:** Voice AI feels more complex and higher-stakes than chatbot. Reader starts thinking "I don't want to mess this up with my actual phone calls."

## 4. CTA Strategy (전체 이북)

| Location | CTA Type | Text | Link |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Ch3 마지막 | Mini CTA (subtle) | "Want us to build this for you?" | → Ch7 페이지 |
| Ch4 마지막 | Mini CTA (nudge) | "This getting complex? We can handle it." | → Ch7 페이지 |
| Ch5 마지막 | Mini CTA (stronger) | "Go live in 7 days instead of 7 weeks." | → Ch7 페이지 |
| Ch6 마지막 | Bridge | "Write down this number." | → Ch7로 자연스럽게 연결 |
| Ch7 Option B | Primary CTA | "Book Your Free Discovery Call" | → Calendly |
| Final Offer | Main CTA | "Book Your Free Discovery Call Now" | → Calendly + QR |

Mini CTA는 갈수록 강해지고, 최종 CTA에서 폭발하는 구조.

## 5. Chatbot Chapter (Ch3) — 이북 vs 실제 서비스

### 이북에서 제공하는 것 (무료 가치)
- Claude 사용법 개념 설명
- 시스템 프롬프트 작성법
- 5개 copy-paste 대화 스크립트
- 기본적인 테스트 방법

### 이북에서 의도적으로 빠지는 것 (서비스로 연결)
- 실제 웹사이트 임베딩 (개발 필요)
- 멀티채널 배포 (WhatsApp, Messenger, SMS)
- 비즈니스 맞춤 학습 데이터 최적화
- 리드 캡처 → CRM 자동 연동
- 지속적인 성능 모니터링 및 개선
- 커스텀 UI 위젯 디자인

"스크립트는 줄게. 근데 이걸 실제로 돌리려면 우리가 필요해." 가 핵심 메시지.
